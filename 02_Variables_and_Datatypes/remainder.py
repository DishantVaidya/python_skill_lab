#Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z.

Y = int(input("Enter the first number :")) # user input for the first number
Z = int(input("Enter the second number :")) # user input for the second number

print(f"Division of given number is {Y/Z} and Remainder is {Y%Z}") 
#printing and dividing two number using "/" 
#And finding remainder using "%" Modulus
